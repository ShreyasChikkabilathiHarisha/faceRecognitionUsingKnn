# faceRecognitionUsingKnn
A picture can say what thousand words fail to express. 
In todayâ€™s world of ever growing digital image count, we can extract more information from these data than we possibly can imagine. 
In this project, we have tried to use images already captured, to extract 4096 facial facial extracts and trained the system to recognize images of 15 celebrities.

In this project, we have used CNN network which uses VGG16 weights for creating facial feature extracts and KNN algorithm for face recognition.
